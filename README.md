# Helium
Helium is simple and inert, like this language!

This project will be using mostly C++20 (with bits of C++23 where conventirnt
e.g: string views).

The goal will be similar to my Fe project, but this time written in C++, partly
due to me wanting to hone my C++ skills further, but also due to the ability to
use automatic pare tree generation libraries more stabily.
